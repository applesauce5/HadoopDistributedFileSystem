# How to run

This specific setup is based on communication between lab machines
- kill
- ls
- less
- cp

The makefile provided makes it so that you can start up each of the servers-----> TO RUN PROJECT
1. make startNameNodeServer ------ will start the name node server and it is currently configured to >> cp.cs.rutgers.edu
2. make startDataNodeServerLS ----- will start data node server 1 which will connect to NameNode >> ls.cs.rutgers.edu
3. make startDataNOdeServerLESS ---- will start data node server 2 which will connect to NameNode >> less.cs.rutgers.edu
4. make startClient ------- will start client program >> kill.cs.rutgers.edu
--> begin user interface


- Note: 
	+each of the executions must be executed within their respected hosts
	+ DataNodeChunks is used to store chunks
All of this is executed in the current directory of source, all configuration settings are in the src/ fold, thought this implementation may not work for all variations of ilab machines

Google Protobuf was used in this project
